# P&P Project (formerly NTBD Project)
- This work proposes a standard software architecture base to perform robot arms' fast applications prototyping; the architecture, which harnesses the power of ROS and the portability of Docker containers, abstracts some software level components that can be implemented accordingly, based on the custom robot arm. 
- P\&P aims at providing a standardized pattern for developing applications for ideally any robot. 
- The P\&P architecture strength lies in the simple structure of its basic version which is suitable for a simple robot arm. Consequently, the structure complexity increases proportionally with the complexity of the robot that has to be integrated with it, avoiding unnecessarily bulky solutions. The project former name was NTBD (Name To Be Decided) and, such a name has been kept for online resources.
